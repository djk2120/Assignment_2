Research Computing final project proposal

Earth System Model parameter sensitivity experiment


In my research I work on vegetation representation in Earth System Models. I developed and implemented a model for vegetation water use in the Community Land Model, which is the land component of NCAR's Community Earth System Model.

For my final project I would like to select a few parameters from the land model and perform a sensitivity experiment. This has the potential for utilizing several of the tools from this course, including shell scripting, data management, file management, and data analysis/visualization.

I think this project will yield a very typical geoscientific computing workflow, with great benefits from organized, reproducible scripting. More specifically I'll have to run an ensemble of simulations, which involves 

1) change parameter value in parameter file (matlab or python)
2) set up and run simulations (unix)
3) collect output from all ensemble members and analyze (matlab or python)

The data visualization could be pretty interesting, especially if I grid sample a multi-dimensional parameter space. 

The downside is that part of this workflow is outside of what could be duplicated upon submission. So maybe I can just show the scripts I use to run the simulations and then supply all the model output.

Thanks,
Daniel
